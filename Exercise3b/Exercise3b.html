        Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never
        see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy
        aureole of
        white hair and a small goatee beard—a clever face, and yet
        somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a
        pair
        of spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep,
        and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was
        delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines
        of the Party—an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a
        child should have been able to see through it, and yet just
        plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that
        other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken
        in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing
        the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was
        advocating
        freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically
        that
        the revolution had been betrayed—and all this in rapid
        polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even
        contained
        Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any
        Party member would normally use in real life. And all the
        while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which
        Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on
        the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the
        Eurasian army—row after row of solid-looking men with
        expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface
        of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers'
        boots
        formed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice.
